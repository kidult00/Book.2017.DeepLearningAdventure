# Word Embeddings

This is a deep neural network method for representing data with a huge number of classes more efficiently. Embeddings greatly improve the ability of networks to learn from data of this sort by representing the data with lower dimensional vectors.

the networks are able to learn semantic relationships between words

These word embeddings are learned using a model called Word2vec.
