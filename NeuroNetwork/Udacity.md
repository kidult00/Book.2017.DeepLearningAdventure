# Convolutional Networks

detect and identify objects in images

use convolutional networks to build an autoencoder

pretrained neural network, transfer learning

# Recurrent Neural Networks

well suited to data that forms sequences like text, music, and time series data

word embeddings and implement the Word2Vec model

# Generative Adversarial Networks
